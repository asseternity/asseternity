## 🧭 About Me
I build **scalable, production-ready web applications** and integrations with structured thinking.  
I own the **full lifecycle** — API design, data modeling, auth & security, testing (Vitest/TDD), and CI/CD.  
I enjoy designing systems that are **easy to extend, reason about, and scale** across the full TypeScript ecosystem.

<summary>🧠 <b>Background</b></summary>

Before engineering, I spent **7+ years as a Senior Associate in BigLaw**, managing $100M+ M&A and dispute resolution cases across energy and finance sectors.  

That legal training shapes how I code — **structured thinking**, **fast learning**, **soft skills**, and **precise problem framing**.  
I approach software architecture with the same discipline and clarity that once won praise from The Legal 500.
