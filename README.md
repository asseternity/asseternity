## 🧭 About Me
I built 7+ scalable, production-ready, full-stack web applications and integrations with 1,000s of user messages, using structured thinking.
I own the full lifecycle — API design, data modeling, auth & security, testing (Vitest/TDD), and CI/CD.  
I enjoy designing systems that are easy to extend, reason about, and scale across the full TypeScript ecosystem.
